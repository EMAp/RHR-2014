  			<h4>James Stevenson</h4>
         <p>James Stevenson was the manager of the Photographic Studio at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Museum of Art and Design 
         	between 1993 and 2013. He has worked as a photographer since 1974 previously at the National Maritime Museum, and within the Health Service 
         	and the Horse-racing Industry.  
				The V&A is one of the largest museum collections in the UK and the image archives managed by the Photographic Studio. 
				The V&A was founded in 1856 with the Photographic Studio being one of the first departments formed within the new institution. The Photographic Studio has 
				managed the archive of images continuously since that time. This period of management covers almost the entire history of the photographic process, 
				with today’s expertise concentrating on the digital environment. Stevenson’s team both produces and manage this large digital archive. The Photographic 
				Studio produces over 50,000 images per year of the museum collection, its buildings and activities. The entire digital archive now comprises of 300,000 digital 
				files of 2D images, QT and movie files and 3D virtual models. 
				Stevenson has been involved in several EU computer graphic research projects notably ARTISTE, SCULPTEUR, ARCO and 3D-COFORM.
				The V&A studio has also participated in many UK funded projects. The products of these projects are now being integrated into current V&A databases. 
				Current activity is concentrating on the issues associated with the digitisation of extremely large cultural heritage collections; their management 
				and how these can be efficiently used by a large international visitor base.
				Stevenson is now joint partner in the company Cultural Heritage Digitisation Ltd in London, which specialises in archival 
				scanning of large works on paper. www.culturalheritagedigitisation.co.uk</p>
